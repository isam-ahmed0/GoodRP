# GoodRP — Discord Rich Presence Client

## What is GoodRP?

GoodRP is a lightweight Windows application that **automatically detects** when you play music, videos, or movies in any app (Spotify, VLC, MPV, Chrome, SoundCloud, etc.) and shows it on Discord as Rich Presence — with **album art, title, artist, album, and real-time progress bar**.

## GoodRP vs CustomRP

GoodRP is its own application. It does **not** use or depend on CustomRP.

Both apps share the same underlying Discord RPC library (`DiscordRichPresence` by Lachee), but they are independent applications that each communicate directly with Discord via IPC pipe. GoodRP works without CustomRP installed.

## Features

- **Auto-detection** — Works with Spotify, VLC, MPV, Chrome (YouTube, SoundCloud), Firefox, Windows Media Player, foobar2000, and any app that uses Windows SMTC
- **Music & Video** — Detects both audio and video playback, shows "Listening to" for music, "Watching" for videos/movies
- **Real-time timestamps** — Progress bar updates live when you skip forward/backward in the player
- **Album art** — Extracts thumbnail from media session, uploads to Cloudinary/Discord/PostImage, shows as Discord RP image
- **Full metadata** — Title, Artist, Album Name, Elapsed Time, Progress Bar
- **Dark GUI** — Discord-style dark theme with connection panel, now playing display, and settings
- **System tray** — Minimizes to tray, runs in background
- **Lightweight** — ~10MB RAM, event-driven (no polling), single executable

## Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Language | C# (.NET 9) | Modern, fast startup, lightweight |
| UI | Windows Forms (dark theme) | Full GUI + system tray |
| Discord RPC | `DiscordRichPresence` NuGet | Same library as CustomRP, well-supported |
| Media Detection | `Windows.Media.Control` | Built-in Windows SMTC API, no polling |
| Album Art Upload | Raw `HttpClient` to Cloudinary/Discord/PostImage APIs | Providers for flexible upload |
| Settings | JSON in `%AppData%\GoodRP\config.json` | Simple, portable |
| Target Framework | `net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0` | Windows 10 1903+ / Windows 11 |

## How It Works

```
1. User opens GoodRP → enters Discord App ID → clicks Connect
   ↓
2. GoodRP monitors Windows SMTC for media sessions
   ↓
3. Media starts playing in any app (Spotify, Chrome, VLC, etc.)
   ↓
4. GoodRP detects: Title, Artist, Album, Position, Duration, Thumbnail
   ↓
5. User clicks "Show on Discord" (or auto-show if enabled)
   ↓
6. Album art uploaded via configured provider (Cloudinary/Discord/PostImage)
    ↓
7. ArtFinderService searches for art if none found, fetches from Deezer/Spotify/Cover Art Archive
    ↓
8. Discord RPC updated with full metadata + real-time progress bar
   ↓
9. When user skips/seeks, timeline updates → Discord RP refreshes instantly
```

## Real-Time Timestamp Updates

GoodRP listens to the `TimelineChanged` event from Windows SMTC. When you skip forward/backward in your player:

1. Player updates its position
2. Windows SMTC fires `TimelinePropertiesChanged` event
3. `MediaWatcher` updates `CurrentMedia.Position`
4. `MediaWatcher` fires `TimelineChanged` event
5. `MainForm` calls `DiscordManager.RefreshPresence()`
6. Discord RPC updates with new timestamp → progress bar moves
